Testing strategies:

There are many strategies for testing and validating LLMs depending on their intended use case. I've implemented a cosine similarity method in the testFramwork module to test the simularity of a known value to the LLM's response. There are countless other strategies to test LLMs. Going through them is outside the scope of this article.

Here's one source I've found useful
